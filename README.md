# sunburst

![alt-text](test.png)

The data in `wordlist` is formatted as a pair of 'word', frequency on every line, parsed by the
sunburst function when read in. 

The source of the data: `http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=y`

Copied html from page source, formatted into python syntax using macros in vim.
Take care to remove the -, ', and / characters (the only '/' is found in
'and/or')
